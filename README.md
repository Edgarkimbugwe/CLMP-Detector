## Dataset Content
The dataset used for this project consists of images of cherry leaves, categorized into two classes: **healthy leaves** and **leaves infected by powdery mildew**. The data was collected to assist in training a machine learning model capable of detecting the presence of powdery mildew on cherry leaves by examining visual symptoms.

### Structure of the Dataset

- **Images:** The dataset contains high-quality images of cherry leaves in RGB format.
- **Classes:** There are two distinct classes:
    - __Healthy:__ Cherry leaves that show no signs of infection.
    - __Powdery mildew:__ Leaves displaying visual signs of white powdery growth and circular lesions.

### Data Distribution

The dataset is split into three subsets for model training and evaluation:
- **Training Set:** Comprising 70% of the data, this set is used for training the model, allowing it to learn the patterns associated with healthy and infected leaves.
- **Validation Set:** 10% of the dataset is used to fine-tune the model during training, helping prevent overfitting.
- **Test Set:** The remaining 20% is reserved for testing the final model, ensuring that it can generalize to new, unseen data.

### Preprocessing Steps

Before using the images for model training, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Resizing:** All images were resized to ensure uniform input size for the neural network.
- **Normalization:** The pixel values were normalized to improve the modelâ€™s ability to learn patterns effectively.
- **Augmentation:** Various data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and zooming were used to increase the robustness of the model by simulating different image perspectives.
